# Total Absorb Amount

![Total Absorb](/.assets/totalabsorb.gif)

Displays total amount of all absorbs on your character. 

Additionally, the combined value of total absorbs + current HP can be displayed as a percentage value of maximum HP. This is mostly relevant for the heroic version of the Kor'kron Dark Shamans encounter, where the Iron Prison ability cast by Wavebinder Kardris deals 100% of maximum hp as damage.
